# Medical Image Processing Mini Project

## ABOUT THE PROJECT:
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a fast and non-invasive medical imaging technique which helps in the investigation of each individual retinal layer structure. For early detection of retinal diseases and the study of their progression, segmentation of the OCT images into the distinct layers of the retina plays a crucial role. However, segmentation done by the clinicians manually is extremely tedious, time-consuming and variable with respect to the expertise level. Hence, there is an utmost necessity to develop an automated segmentation algorithm for retinal OCT images which is fast, accurate, and eases clinical decision making.

## GOALS OF THIS PROJECT:
The goals for this project are as follows:
- To delineate intra-retinal boundaries in retinal SD-OCT images.
- To compute retinal layer thicknesses which can be compared to histological   thickness values to ease diagnosis of ocular diseases.
- To compare the effects of denoising in accurate boundary delineation.
- To validate the automated segmentation results by clinical experts.
